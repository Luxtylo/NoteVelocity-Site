					<h1>NoteVelocity is:</h1>
					<h2>Fast</h2>
					<para>We know that teachers and lecturers won't stop for you to catch up. Fortunately, NoteVelocity is rather speedy. Starting up within 0.5 seconds, even on the slowest of netbooks, with NoteVelocity you can be taking notes almost instantly.With its keyboard shortcuts and special characters, you can take even complex notes with equations and formatting without so much as touching your trackpad.</para>
					<h2>Awesome</h2>
					<para>Frustrated with clicking around menus with a tiny laptop trackpad? Not any more. NoteVelocity's menus are designed to be navigated with a trackpad or keyboard, so you can quickly and easily get to complex settings.</para>
					<para>Designed to be simple, NoteVelocity doesn't hide anything from you. Everything is only a couple of clicks or taps away.</para>
					<h2>Slick</h2>
					<para>NoteVelocity's interface is simple and easy to navigate. Instead of wrestling with frustrating menus and infuriating default settings, you'll be using the full potential of your fingers and your brain to take some of the best notes you've ever taken. We also think it looks pretty good, but that's really for you to decide.</para>
					<h2>Terrific</h2>
					<para>Not much to say here, we just needed a word beginning with a "T". We could also have gone with "Temporal", "Trippy" or "Tagliatelle", but they don't really describe NoteVelocity very well. Give NoteVelocity a try to see just how terrific it really is.</para>
